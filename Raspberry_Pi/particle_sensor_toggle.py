#  particle_sensor_toggle.py

#  Optional advanced demo. This program shows how to generate an output 
#  control signal from one of the Pi pins, which can be used to turn 
#  the particle sensor on and off. An external transistor circuit is
#  also needed - this will gate the sensor power supply according to 
#  the control signal.
   
#  The program continually measures and displays all environment data
#  in a repeating cycle. The user can view the output in the Serial 
#  Monitor. After reading the data, the particle sensor is powered off 
#  for a chosen number of cycles ("off_cycles"). It is then powered on 
#  and read before being powered off again. Sound data are ignored 
#  while the particle sensor is on, to avoid fan noise.
